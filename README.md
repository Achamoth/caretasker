# Telstra Health Hackathon 2022 - Team 4

## Problem

Nursing shortages in aged care, with a specific focus on bringing retired nurses back into the industry.

## Solution

At a very high level, a unified web and mobile platform to facilitate locum nursing.
- Nurses build profiles, including skills, relevant qualifications and certifications, availabilities etc.
- Organizations build profiles and post jobs

The platform then matches the two, providing auto-recommendations and facilitating the entire engagement. The goal is an end-to-end experience, so the platform would necessarily handle
- Verifying certifications and qualifications
- Feedback process (both ways)
- Payroll
- Integrations with training platforms and providers

## Scope

Obviously the solution described above is a comprehensive and large piece of software, including many third-party integrations and logistical challenges (payroll etc.).

The scope of this work is to build an extremely simple front-end page (against mocked data). I'm not delivering any real functionality; just a basic visual representation of what a provider's profile might look like, with some room for qualifications, a weekly calendar where they can specify their availabilities, and a list of any upcoming and recommended shifts (the latter being calculated against the selected availabilities dynamically).

I hope to add a few different visual representations of some relevant concepts i.e. verified/unverified status for qualifications.
